# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
Analyze PH employee database using PostgreSQL to help the company anticipate the "silver tsunami" as many current employees will leave to retirement.\
For this analysis we will:

2. identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Resources
- Data Source: departments.csv, dept_manager.csv, dept_emp.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv
- Software: PostgreSQL 11.9, Visual Studio Code 1.48.2
